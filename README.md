# DGTL13007-Project-Files

Everyone should be able to add and delete files

I recomend using GitHub desktop to more easily fetch and commit changes

---------------------------------------------------

Sometimes when pushing changes you will get a error stating file is too big (over 100mb). This might be because some package caches are too big. 

If this happens, first undo the commit at the bottom left in GitHub Desktop, after which you can simply delete the Package cache folder located in the Library:

DGTL13007-Project-Files-main\Kearney\Library\ PackageCache

These packages will re-import themselves when the project is opened again, so its safe to delete
